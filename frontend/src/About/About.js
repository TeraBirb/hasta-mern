                Prospective home or apartment renters face the challenge of
                navigating multiple rental listing platforms during their
                search. This inefficient and fragmented process is
                time-consuming, often leading to missed opportunities and
                frustration. The amount of scattered information across
                disjointed platforms can also be overwhelming. The proposed
                software product, Home/Apartment Rental Site Aggregator (Hasta),
                aims to address this business problem by aggregating listings
                from commonly used rental listing platforms into a central
                platform where users can manage, search, and save listings all
                within a user-friendly interface. This will eliminate the need
                to manually comb through several listing platforms, enhancing
                user experience by streamlining the rental search process. Hasta
                saves users valuable time and effort, allowing them to focus on
                finding their ideal home.
